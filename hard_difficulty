Question 5:
Each admission costs $50 for patients without insurance, and $10 for patients with insurance. All patients with an even patient_id have insurance.
Give each patient a 'Yes' if they have insurance, and a 'No' if they don't have insurance. Add up the admission_total cost for each has_insurance group.

-- to have insurance means: patient_id % 2 = 0 then it's even
-- price with insurance: 10, price without insurance: 50
-- even number patient_id == patient with insurance
